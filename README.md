# 🍳 Recipe Assistant

URL: https://recipe-assistant-719fe.web.app/

Recipe Assistant is a modern web application built with **React + TypeScript** that helps users save, organize, and share recipes without the clutter of ad-heavy cooking websites.

The app solves the frustration of scrolling through long recipe blogs just to find the ingredient list or instructions. By leveraging **Google Gemini AI**, Recipe Assistant extracts clean, structured recipes that can be stored in personal accounts, making meal planning simple and enjoyable.

This project showcases skills in **full-stack development, AI integration, and cloud deployment** — from authentication and database management with **Firebase** to automated **CI/CD pipelines** with GitHub Actions and Firebase Hosting.
